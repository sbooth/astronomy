# Astronomy Engine (JavaScript / TypeScript)

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/astronomy-engine.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astronomy-engine)

This is the complete programming reference for the JavaScript version
of Astronomy Engine. It supports client side programming
in the browser, and backend use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

[Astronomy Engine is available as an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astronomy-engine).

Both the browser and backend versions of the JavaScript code are generated from
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) code in `astronomy.ts`,
which is also provided here for those who want to use it directly.

Other programming languages are supported also.
See the [home page](https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy) for more info.

## Quick Start
To use Astronomy Engine in your own project, you can use the TypeScript file `astronomy.ts`
from this directory.

For convenience, this directory also contains human-readable JavaScript files `astronomy.js`
and minified versions for the browser (`astronomy.browser.min.js`) and Node.js (`astronomy.min.js`).
These JavaScript sources are all compiled from the TypeScript source `astronomy.ts`.

To get started quickly, here are some [browser scripting examples](../../demo/browser/)
and some [Node.js examples](../../demo/nodejs/).

### Coordinate transforms

The following orientation systems are supported.
Astronomy Engine can convert a vector from any of these orientations to any of the others.
It also allows converting from a vector to spherical (angular) coordinates and back,
within a given orientation. Note the 3-letter codes for each of the orientation systems;
these are used in function and type names.

- **EQJ = J2000 Mean Equator**: Uses the Earth's mean equator (corrected for precession but ignoring nutation) on January 1, 2000, at noon UTC. This moment in time is called J2000.
- **EQD = True Equator of Date**: Uses the Earth's equator on a given date and time, adjusted for precession and nutation.
- **ECL = J2000 Mean Ecliptic**: Uses the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun at J2000. The x-axis is referenced against the J2000 mean equinox.
- **ECT = True Ecliptic of Date**: Uses the true (corrected for precession and nutation) orbital plane of the Earth on the given date. The x-axis is referenced against the true equinox for that date.
- **HOR = Horizontal**: Uses the viewpoint of an observer at a specific location on the Earth at a given date and time.
- **GAL = Galactic**: Based on the IAU 1958 definition of galactic coordinates.

### Gravitational simulation of small bodies

Astronomy Engine provides a [GravitySimulator](#GravitySimulator) class
that allows you to model the trajectories of one or more small bodies like asteroids,
comets, or coasting spacecraft. If you know an initial position vector
and velocity vector for a small body, the gravity simulator can incrementally
simulate the pull of gravity on it from the Sun and planets, to calculate its
movement through the Solar System.
